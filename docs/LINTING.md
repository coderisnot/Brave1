# Linting

For Ruby we use [standardrb](https://github.com/testdouble/standard) to standardize our project.

To run simply open the project and run in the terminal

```sh
bundle exec standardrb
```

For Typescript/Stylesheets we use [tslint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) and [stylelint](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint) respectively.

To run simply open the project and run in the terminal

```sh
yarn lint
```
